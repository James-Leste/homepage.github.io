<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master's student in Computer Science at Aalto University. I mainly work with python and Javascript, participating in some cloud-computing researches and business development. I wish to land a summer job after 2023-2024 academic year as a software engineer or a developer. If you are hiring, feel free to email me at ziqi.wang@aalto.fi.

My interests land on the intersection of cloud computing, big data and software engineering. I have done related researches and courses at the university.
