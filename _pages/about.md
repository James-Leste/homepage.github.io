# üö∂üèª About Me

I am a 2nd master's student in Computer Science at Aalto University. I do full stack development, UI design, software architecture design and data anlysis.

My interests land on the intersection of cloud computing, software infrastructure and AI.

In my spare time, I actively contribute to open-source projects to keep myself updated with newly emerged technologies and build useful tools to elevate sustainability and improve efficiency. I am a quick learner and good at using online resources (official documentations, YouTube videos) to expand my expertise. My technical interests lie in developing embedded software/network architectures. Additionally, I enjoy running, hiking, playing basketball and playing video games to relax during holidays, and weekends.
